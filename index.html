    <p>The logic based sudoku puzzle is, in its simplest form, made of a 9x9 grid. In which, the numbers 1 to 9 must be used only once to complete each row, column and 3x3 subgrid.
       It is thought to originate from the mathematical idea of the latin square, and first appeared in its modern form in a New York-based puzzle magazine in the late 1970s. 
       A good sudoku puzzle only has a single solution.</p>
